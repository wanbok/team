## Workflow

```
Phase 0: Team Composition [user approval]
  → Phase 1: Discovery [user approval]
  → Phase 2: Design [user approval]
  → Phase 3: Development [auto]
  → Phase 4: QA [auto]
  → Phase 5: Finalization [auto]
```

## Mandatory Rules

1. NO code before requirements are approved
2. ALL code must have tests written FIRST (TDD)
3. Each teammate only edits their own directories
4. Use verification-before-completion before ANY completion claims
5. QA reviews all major features
6. After Phase 2 approval, DO NOT STOP until Phase 5 is complete
7. Only work on tasks assigned to YOU

## Quality Standards

- Unit test coverage: 80%+
- Code review: all major features
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA (if applicable)
